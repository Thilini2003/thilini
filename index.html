    <h2>..Flowers Information..</h2>
    <p> A flower is the bloom or blossom of a plant. The flower is the part of a plant that produces seeds, which in
        time become other flowers. This is thanks to a process called pollination that is carried out either by insects
        or the wind. <strong>Every type of flower is different, in colour, smell, shape and size</strong>.</p>

                gardens and borders. For the best massing effect,<strong>plant snowdrops in clusters of at least 25
                    bulbs, spacing them about 3 inches apart</strong>. </td>

                beginning gardeners. Their trumpet-shaped flowers are typically yellow or white and they grow best in
                full sun or light shade. For best results, plant in masses in a perennial garden, or let them naturalize
                in a woodland garden.</td>

    <h2>..Benifits for flowers..</h2>
    <p>Multiple studies show that proximity to plants has profound health benefits for human beings. We all know that a
        bouquet of flowers can convey appreciation, but research finds that simply being around <strong>flowers also
            reduces stress, speeds healing, enhances concentration, and improves mood</strong></p>
